            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, I am Jonathan! I'm a 20-year-old senior at the University of South Florida, majoring in
                cybersecurity. With a solid foundation in technology and design cultivated over the past 10 years, I've found my
                passion in design specifically, video editing. I enjoy spending my time working on projects using software like Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects. In addition to my academic
                pursuits, I've been working Starbucks for two years, which has been a great help financially while also pursuing my education.
                Simultaneously, my year-long experience as a substitute teacher in Hillsborough County has
                allowed me to connect with diverse learning environments.
